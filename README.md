## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install langchain openai



import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"


import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
response = llm("Your prompt here")
print(response)



### Instructions for Use:
1. Replace `your-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. Update the `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
3. Modify any sections as needed to reflect your specific implementation details or findings. 

Feel free to add more sections or details as required!
